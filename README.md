# Design Patterns

The course is based on the design patterns book authored by _Gang of four_, and contains 23 patterns divided into:

1. Creational: that shows different ways of creating an object
2. Structural: that are about the relationships between those objects
3. Behavioral: that are about the interaction and communication between objects

## UML

Unified Modeling Language is used to represent classes in a diagram

- Minus sign means private
- Positive means public
- The arrow means inheritance
- Arrow with a square means composition
- Dashed arrow means dependency, the second class is referenced in the first class (argument, variable, etc.)
